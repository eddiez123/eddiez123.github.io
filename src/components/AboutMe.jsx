                    University of Maryland, College Park. </h3>
            <p>Join me as I document my journey and growth 
                as a software engineer. The projects incorporated in this 
                portfolio are all milestones and achievements 
                that I take great pride in.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my time at both Ernst & Young and UMD, I've gotten experience
                building tools with Python, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and much more.
                I never thought I would develop an interest in coding, but here I am, 
                solving real-world problems with data analysis and thoughtful UI, and I am
                loving every second of it.
            </p>
